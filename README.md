# Learn-Neural-Nets
This repository is created to make learning artificial intelligence and its complexities easily understandable to anyone with high-school math knowledge and a basic understanding of programming.
The harsh truth is that learning AI involves lot of advance math like calculus (single & muti variable), linear algebra, probability, statistics, optimization, real-analysis, etc.
While learning the principles of AI, whenever we encounter advance math usage, I will do one of the following things:
1. include a link to that particular concept, which will provide all the details required
2. explain that topic there and then

I created this repository so that a wider audience is able to start learning and using AI to make the world a better place.
